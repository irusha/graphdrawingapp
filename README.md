# graphdrawingapp
You can draw graphs on the terminal with this program. Pretty useless right? Well one day even the dog poop could be useful for something. So I am posting this anyway. Dear recruiters, please don't judge me by this description. So anyway, you can draw two types of graphs with this. Bar graphs and dot graphs. You can simply push a double array into the drawGraph method with dotted argument (It will set the graph mode as dotted or bar graph). Also you can send various doubles to the graph using addData method (returns a double array). In the current settings, the application will fetch the bitcoin price and then it will pass that value to setGraphData() method. Then setGraphData() method will add these values to an array. After getting 25 values into the array, drawGraph() method will be executed and the graph will be displayed. It will automatically adjust its scale relevant to the data you are providing. With minimum modifications, you can use this program to display graphs in the terminal. I didn't comment because I was busy debugging my already useless code.
