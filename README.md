# graphdrawingapp
You can draw graphs on the terminal with this program. Pretty useless right? Well one day even the dog poop could be useful for something. So I am posting this anyway. Dear recruiters, please don't judge me by this description. So anyway, you can draw two types of graphs with this. Bar graphs and dot graphs. You can simply push a double array into the drawGraph method with dotted argument (It will set the graph mode as dotted or bar graph). Also you can send various doubles to the graph using addData method (returns a double array). I didn't commented because I was busy debugging my already useless code. If you want me to comment, send me an email to irushaathukorala(at)gmail.com.
